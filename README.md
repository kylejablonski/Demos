# ArrayAdapter ListViewDemo

Purpose of this demo is to show the use of an ArrayAdapter with a custom data type. 

ArrayAdapters are pretty usefull when displaying simple data in a list, this demo displays a bit more complex data.

In a custom object override the toString() method to return the value you want to supply to the TextView in the ArrayAdapter.
